# Music_Recommendation_Based_On_Facial_Emotion_Recognition
This is the repository for the final year major project named - "Music Recommendation Based on Facial Emotion Recognition".
We created an GUI application for the project where the user can get a music playlist based on their facial emotion that is detected by our system.
Here in our project, the main focus is on emotion detection.
#### For emotion detection, we used three machine learning algorithms: SVM, Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
#### For training the model, we used three datasets: FER-2013, CK+48 and our self-created dataset.

The best model that is suited for real-time emotion detection is from SVM and self-created dataset.
